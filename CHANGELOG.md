# Neuro Flow 24.2.0 (2024-02-16)

### Features

- `${{ project.project_name }}` now also configures `volume`'s remote path and `image` reference if the project name was not set.

  If you do not have `project_name` set in `project.yaml`, the volume paths are assumed within your current project configured in CLI.
  However, if you set `project_name`, this project will be assumed while managing jobs, bakes, volumes, building images etc. within this flow. ([#1081](https://github.com/neuro-inc/neuro-flow/issues/1081))
- Added support of extra Kaniko arguments while building an image:

  ```
  images:
	image_a:
	  ref: image:imagea
	  context: dir
	  dockerfile: dir/Dockerfile
	  extra_kaniko_args: >-
		--reproducible
		--cache-ttl=1h
		--single-snapshot
  ```

  More details on available arguments could be found in [official Kaniko documentation](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/kaniko?tab=readme-ov-file#additional-flags). ([#1110](https://github.com/neuro-inc/neuro-flow/issues/1110))


# Neuro Flow 23.11.0 (2023-11-15)

### Features

- `${{ project.project_name }}` now also configures `volume`'s remote path and `image` reference if the project name was not set.

  If you do not have `project_name` set in `project.yaml`, the volume paths are assumed within your current project configured in CLI.
  However, if you set `project_name`, this project will be assumed while managing jobs, bakes, volumes, building images etc. within this flow. ([#1081](https://github.com/neuro-inc/neuro-flow/issues/1081))
- Add retries for read-only operations on Server Unavailable error. ([#1085](https://github.com/neuro-inc/neuro-flow/issues/1085))

# Neuro Flow 22.8.1 (2022-08-05)
==============================

Features
--------

- Added `hash_files_relative` function to expression, it works same as `hash_files` but requires additional leading
  parameters that defines directory to glob over. It can be used to glob over action files:
  ```
	${{ hash_files_relative(flow.action_path, "**/pattern/here/**/*.py", "other/**/pattern")
  ``` ([#904](https://github.com/neuro-inc/neuro-flow/issues/904))


Neuro Flow 22.8.0 (2022-08-04)
==============================

Features
--------

- Added support of `flow.action_path` for images sections of action. ([#902](https://github.com/neuro-inc/neuro-flow/issues/902))


Neuro Flow 22.7.2 (2022-07-28)
==============================

Features
--------

- Implement `flow.action_path` property in the flow context.  It is available from action and points to the folder where `action.yml` file is located. ([#896](https://github.com/neuro-inc/neuro-flow/issues/896))
- Replace HTTP fetch with git clone for remote actions. ([#897](https://github.com/neuro-inc/neuro-flow/issues/897))


Neuro Flow 22.7.1 (2022-07-25)
==============================

Bugfixes
--------

- Use a separate src folder to don install tests when installing neuro-flow. ([#891](https://github.com/neuro-inc/neuro-flow/issues/891))


Neuro Flow 22.7.0 (2022-07-25)
==============================

Features
--------

- Implement `neuro-flow init` command for easy flow creation ([#859](https://github.com/neuro-inc/neuro-flow/issues/859))


Neuro Flow 22.6.0 (2022-06-07)
==============================

Features
--------

- Add support of shared server side projects. ([#840](https://github.com/neuro-inc/neuro-flow/issues/840))
- Display times with timezones in log messages. ([#847](https://github.com/neuro-inc/neuro-flow/issues/847))


Neuro Flow 22.4.3 (2022-04-21)
==============================

Bugfixes
--------

- Fixed error when trying to build image in batch mode ([#818](https://github.com/neuro-inc/neuro-flow/issues/818))


Neuro Flow 22.4.2 (2022-04-01)
==============================

No significant changes.


Neuro Flow 22.3.0 (2022-03-29)
==============================

Bugfixes
--------

- Fixed problem with click 8.1.0

Neuro Flow 22.1.0 (2022-01-26)
==============================

Features
--------

- Support ${{ matrix.ORDINAL }} as unique 0-based index for selected rows.

  If a batch flow has a matrix, all matrix rows are enumerated.
  The ordinal number of each row is available as `${{ matrix.ORDINAL }}` system value. ([#693](https://github.com/neuro-inc/neuro-flow/issues/693))
- Add support of expressions in matrix definition.

  You can now use expression to define list of matrix products. In examples here and below,
  both `old_way_key` and `new_way_key` produce same list of values:

  ```
  matrix:
	old_way_key: ["1", "2", "3"]
	new_way_key: ${{ ["1", "2", "3"] }}
  ```

  This can be helpful when used together with new `range()` function:

  ```
  matrix:
	old_way_key: [0, 1, 2, 3]
	new_way_key: ${{ range(4) }}
  ```

  The `range()` function supports same parameters as python's `range()`, but it returns list.
  For example: `${{ range(1, 4) }}` generates `[1,2,3]`, and `${{ range(4, 1, -1) }}` generates
  `[4,3,2]`.

  As sometimes plain numbers is not best options for matrix products, you can use list comprehension
  to perform some mapping:

  ```
  matrix:
	old_way_key: ["k1", "k2", "k3"]
	new_way_key: ${{ [fmt("k{}", str(it)) for it in range(1, 4)] }}
  ```

  You can also filter some values in comprehension same way as in python:

  ```
  matrix:
	old_way_key: [0, 4, 16]
	new_way_key: ${{ [it * it for it in range(1, 5) if it % 2 == 0] }}
  ``` ([#741](https://github.com/neuro-inc/neuro-flow/issues/741))


Bugfixes
--------

- Fixed (disabled) uploads to storage in dry-run mode ([#732](https://github.com/neuro-inc/neuro-flow/issues/732))


Neuro Flow 21.11.2 (2021-11-26)
===============================

Features
--------

- Technical release, compatible with the latest SDK/CLI.


Neuro Flow 21.11.0 (2021-11-23)
===============================

--------

- Allow `bash` and `python` code blocks in local actions. ([#667](https://github.com/neuro-inc/neuro-flow/issues/667))
- Add `-s/--suffix` option usage hint for cases when the live job launched without it. ([#679](https://github.com/neuro-inc/neuro-flow/issues/679))


Bugfixes
--------

- Handle cached image status color in `neuro-flow inspect <bake>`. ([#657](https://github.com/neuro-inc/neuro-flow/issues/657))
- Fixed parsing of bash and python in mixins ([#674](https://github.com/neuro-inc/neuro-flow/issues/674))
- Fix parsing of 'bash' and 'python' usage in project config. ([#678](https://github.com/neuro-inc/neuro-flow/issues/678))
- Fixed logging of filename as "." for github actions. ([#681](https://github.com/neuro-inc/neuro-flow/issues/681))


Neuro Flow 21.10.0 (2021-10-27)
===============================

Features
--------

- Added new context called git. It has following attributes:

  - ${{ git.sha }} -- SHA of current commit
  - ${{ git.branch }} - name of current branch
  - ${{ git.tags }} - list of tags that point to current commit

  This context is available everywhere both in live and batch mode, but it can only be used
  if project's workspace is inside some git repository. ([#603](https://github.com/neuro-inc/neuro-flow/issues/603))
- Added ternary operator to expressions: `${{ left if condition else right }}` will evaluate to `left`
  if `condition` is True and to `right` otherwise. ([#605](https://github.com/neuro-inc/neuro-flow/issues/605))
- Allowed ']]' and '}}' in yaml literal strings. ([#607](https://github.com/neuro-inc/neuro-flow/issues/607))
- Added column with batch name to output of `neuro-flow bakes`. ([#618](https://github.com/neuro-inc/neuro-flow/issues/618))
- Enabled detailed automatic logging to file. For locally executed commands, logs will
  go to `~/.neuro/logs` directory. Remote executor detailed logs will go to `storage:.flow/logs/<bake_id>/`. ([#622](https://github.com/neuro-inc/neuro-flow/issues/622))
- Added support of non-string types for action inputs. Now, one can specify action input in following way:

  ```
  inputs:
	arg1:
	  descr: Input with implicit string type
	arg2:
	  descr: Input with explicit string type
	  type: str
	arg2:
	  descr: Input with explicit int type and corresponding default
	  type: int
	  default: 42
  ```

  Supported types are `int`, `float`, `bool`, `str`. On action calls side, it's now possible to use
  corresponding yaml types as arguments. ([#626](https://github.com/neuro-inc/neuro-flow/issues/626))
- Added possibility to specify job/bake params via the shortcut `-p` for `--param`. ([#629](https://github.com/neuro-inc/neuro-flow/issues/629))


Neuro Flow 21.9 (2021-09-29)
==============================

Features
--------

- Renamed `inherits` yaml property to `mixins`. ([#560](https://github.com/neuro-inc/neuro-flow/issues/560))
- Added support project level `mixins`. Mixins defined in `project.yml` available both for live and batch configurations,
  so they cannot define any live or batch specific properties. ([#562](https://github.com/neuro-inc/neuro-flow/issues/562))
- Added command `neuro-flow delete-project <project-id>` that allows complete removal of project. ([#581](https://github.com/neuro-inc/neuro-flow/issues/581))


Bugfixes
--------

- Fix crash with global images in batch mode. ([#544](https://github.com/neuro-inc/neuro-flow/issues/544))


Misc
----

- [#580](https://github.com/neuro-inc/neuro-flow/issues/580)


Neuro Flow 21.7.9 (2021-07-09)
==============================

Features
--------

- Added new sections `defaults`, `images`, `volumes` to the `project.yml` file. The work the same as the do in `live`/`batch` except they are global -- everything defined in `project.yml` applies to all workflows. (#506)


Neuro Flow 21.7.7 (2021-7-7)
============================

Features
--------


- Added modules feature: a module is simillar to action but has following differneces:
  - only local files support (`ws:` scheme), github located modules are forbidden.
  - the module content has access to workflow global defaults. The default env/volumes/preset
  is inherited, and expressions can access top level contexts such as `flow`.

  Calling a module is similar to calling an action, except for use of `module` property
  instead of `action` property:

  Live module call:
  ```
  jobs:
	test:
	  module: ws:live-module
	  args:
		arg1: val 1
  ```

  Batch module call:
  ```
  tasks:
	- id: test
	  module: ws:batch-module
	  args:
		arg1: val 1
  ``` ([#464](https://github.com/neuro-inc/neuro-flow/issues/464))

- Add support of mixins in live and batch mode.

  Mixins allow to define and reuse some common parts of jobs in live mode and tasks in batch mode.
  To define a mixin, use top level `mixins` sections:
  ```
  ...
  mixins:
	credentials:
	  volumes:
		- secret:some_key:/var/some_key
	  env:
		KEY_LOCATION: /var/some_key
  ...
  ```

  Mixins can define the same properties as "job" and "task" do, except for "id" field in batch mode.
  To apply a mixin, use `inherits` property:

  ```
  ...
  jobs:
	test_a:
	  inherits: [ credentials ]
  ...
  ```

  When applied, all fields defined in mixin will be merged into job definition.
  You can apply multiple mixins simultaneously. If some of applied mixins share the same property,
  or/and it is defined in task, the following rules are applied:
  - If property is scalar (int/string/bool), then job will use value defined in job definition. If it is absent,
  the value from the rightmost of the mixins that define this property will be used:
  ```
  mixins:
	mix1:
	  image: example_mix1
	mix2:
	  image: example_mix2
  jobs:
	job1:
	  inherits: [mix1, mix2]
	  image: example
	job2:
	  inherits: [mix1, mix2]
  ```
  The `job1` will use `example` image, and `job2` will use `example_mix2` image.
  - If property is list, that all lists will be concatenated.
  - If property is dict, that rule for scalars will be applied for dict values separately.

  Mixins can inherit from each other:
  ```
  mixins:
	mix1:
	  env:
		TEST: 1
	mix2:
	  inherits: [ mix1 ]
	  image: example
  ``` ([#498](https://github.com/neuro-inc/neuro-flow/issues/498))


Bugfixes
--------


- Improved performance of `neuro flow bakes` it will now print only new rows instead of re-rendering all table ([#501](https://github.com/neuro-inc/neuro-flow/issues/501))

--------

- Fix a bug with processing SKIPPED task


Neuro Flow 21.5.17 (2021-05-17)
===============================

Features
--------

- Neuro Flow now uses the dedicated Platform API to store the flow database. The storage is still supported but will be removed in a few months.

- Added new expressions functions:
  - `values(dict_instance)`: get values of dictionary (similar to python's `dict_instance.values()`)
  - `str(any)`: convert any object to string
  - `replace(string, old, new)`: replace all occurrences of `old` in `string` with `new`.
  - `join(separator, array)`: concatenate array of strings inserting `separator` in between. ([#357](https://github.com/neuro-inc/neuro-flow/issues/357))

- Added support of default volumes similar to default env: both in live and batch modes, you can
  specify them under `defaults` section:
  ```
  defaults:
	volumes:
	  - storage:some/dir:/mnt/some/dir
	  - storage:some/another/dir:/mnt/some/another/dir
  ```
  - In live mode such volumes will be added to all jobs.
  - In batch mode such volumes will be added to all tasks.

  Default volumes are not passed to actions (same as default env). ([#359](https://github.com/neuro-inc/neuro-flow/issues/359))

- Added passing of global options (`-v`, `-q`, `--show-traceback`) to neuro cli and executor. ([#360](https://github.com/neuro-inc/neuro-flow/issues/360))

- Added `--dry-run` flag for `neuro-flow run` that enables prints job command instead of running it. ([#362](https://github.com/neuro-inc/neuro-flow/issues/362))

- Added support of tagging bakes.

  To tag a bake:
  ```
  neuro bake --tag tag1 --tag tag2 batch_name
  ```
  To retrieve bakes by tags:
  ```
  neuro bakes --tag tag1
  ``` ([#382](https://github.com/neuro-inc/neuro-flow/issues/382))


Bugfixes
--------


- Fixed bug that led to crash in `neuro-flow inspect` when bake had cached task. ([#358](https://github.com/neuro-inc/neuro-flow/issues/358))

- Add bake_id tag to jobs started by bake inside neuro platform. ([#320](https://github.com/neuro-inc/neuro-flow/issues/320))

- Add tags to remote executor jobs. The tags are: "project:project_id", "flow:flow_name", "bake:bake_id",
  "remote_executor". ([#321](https://github.com/neuro-inc/neuro-flow/issues/321))

- Print name of the action in error about unexpected needs entry, for example:
  ```
  ERROR: Action 'ws:some_action' does not contain task 'wrong_task_name'
  ``` ([#323](https://github.com/neuro-inc/neuro-flow/issues/323))

- Added printing of filename in expression evaluation errors. ([#324](https://github.com/neuro-inc/neuro-flow/issues/324))

- Dropped `outputs.needs` in batch actions. Made all action task results available for calculation action needs.
  This avoids confusing behavior when action can succeed even when some of its tasks have failed. ([#325](https://github.com/neuro-inc/neuro-flow/issues/325))

- Add support of empty list and dict (`[]` and `{}`) in expressions. ([#333](https://github.com/neuro-inc/neuro-flow/issues/333))

- Added validation of tasks `needs` property. ([#334](https://github.com/neuro-inc/neuro-flow/issues/334))

- Added validation of action arguments before starting a bake. ([#336](https://github.com/neuro-inc/neuro-flow/issues/336))

- Implemented marking of bake as failed when an error happens during the batch execution. If the error is caused
  because of SIGINT, the bake will be marked as cancelled instead of failed. ([#338](https://github.com/neuro-inc/neuro-flow/issues/338))

- Allow to specify timeout for executor job in yaml and increase default lifespan to 7d. Example:
  ```
  kind: batch
  life_span: 30d
  tasks:
	...
  ``` ([#339](https://github.com/neuro-inc/neuro-flow/issues/339))

- Add support of local actions inside of batch actions if they do not depend on any remote tasks. ([#340](https://github.com/neuro-inc/neuro-flow/issues/340))


Bugfixes
--------


- Use 1-based indexes instead of 0-based for lines and columns in error messages. ([#335](https://github.com/neuro-inc/neuro-flow/issues/335))

===============================

Bugfixes
--------


- Fix executor restart when there is a action that should be marked as ready. ([#315](https://github.com/neuro-inc/neuro-flow/issues/315))


Neuro Flow 21.3.3 (2021-03-03)
==============================

Features
--------


- Add support of parsing batch params from file. ([#295](https://github.com/neuro-inc/neuro-flow/issues/295))


Bugfixes
