# Project configuration syntax

{% hint style="warning" %}
Platform project semantics differs from apolo-flow projects. Refer apolo-flow project as a set of related workflows. This collision is temporal.
{% endhint %}

By default, the project name is generated automatically based on the name of the flow folder (a folder that contains a `.apolo` subfolder for configuration YAML files).

Name autogeneration will only work if the folder's name starts with a letter or an underscore symbol (`_`) and contains only letters, digits, or underscores. `ALL_CAPS` names are not supported.

To override this, you can put the `project.yml`(or `project.yaml`) file into the `.apolo` configuration folder.

## id

Project `id` available as a `${{ project.id }}` or `${{ flow.project_id }}` context. Default value - folder name, where '.apolo' folder is located.

## owner

Optional owner name available as a `${{ project.owner }}` context. Shared projects require `owner` or `role`.

## project\_name

Platform project name, where the flow belongs to. Available as `${{ project.project_name }}`. Default value -  the currently selected project in Apolo CLI configuration.

## role

{% hint style="warning" %}
Flow roles are deprecated and will be ignored. To grant access to the flow and its artifacts, please add users to the corresponding platform project using `apolo admin add-project-user`.
{% endhint %}

Optional project role name available as a `${{ project.role }}` context. By default the `role` is `{owner}/projects/{id}` if `owner` is defined. Shared projects require `owner` or `role`. This role name might be used to share the project with other platform `<user>` via `apolo acl grant <role> <user>`

## Project-wide configuration

You can define jobs and workflows globally by specifying the desired project-wide behavior in the following sections of the `project.yml` file:

* defaults
* images
* volumes
* mixins

You can find detailed descriptions of how to use the `defaults`, `images`, and `volumes` sections in the corresponding parts of the [live workflows syntax](live-workflow-syntax/) and [batch workflow syntax](batch-workflow-syntax/) documentation.

You can [learn more about mixins here](../mixins.md).

All settings specified in `project.yml` will be applied by default to all jobs and workflows of this project.
